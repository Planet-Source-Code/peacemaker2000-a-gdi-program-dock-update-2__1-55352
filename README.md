### Description

Now you can draw text with each icon and set the the position (top, right, etc.) via gdiPosition variable and I fixed the App.Path thing, the memory leak was allready fixed last time ... Here is the transparent version of my DirectX Program Dock, but this time based on GDI+. Big thanks to Apeiron for his Per Pixel Transparency code which made this version possible. Again you need to create a folder called (“icons”) in App.Path and put some PNG-Files in it. For the screenshot I used a PNG set from http://www.rokey.net/ but you can add any 128x128 PNG files you want.
